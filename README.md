# Metroid Prime Damageless Ruleset
- The run must be completed without taking damage. This includes fractional damage (damage less than 1 unit of health), so anything that triggers the "arrgh" sound effect or turns the HUD orange counts as taking damage.
- The run must be single segment with video and audio commentary.
- Only Gamecube versions are allowed.
- The Metroid Prime [Permadeath Mod](https://github.com/mills5/prime-permadeath-patcher) is allowed, but not required for submission.

The first runner to submit a valid run will be rewarded $1,000 USD (PayPal) or BTC equivalent. Runs shall be first sent to any [Metroid Prime Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.com/invite/WX9P6jnW) Moderator for validation, then to `jack the rigger#6849` to claim the reward.

happy running
